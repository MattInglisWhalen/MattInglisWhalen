Hi! Iâ€™m @MattInglisWhalen, a PhD graduate from the Univerity of Toronto where I worked in 
theoretical particle physics studying Effective Field Theories for Quantum Chromodynamics.

I'm interested in building and deploying useful software tools for business-oriented solutions.
I have a strong background in numerical optimization, statistics, and data
modeling, and have many years of experience in harnessing these skills 
to find key insights from data.

I also have a few side projects in game development. My studio is Welcomeblack Gaming, where 
I make small but action-packed VR games, and the most recent release is called Thread the Void VR.
