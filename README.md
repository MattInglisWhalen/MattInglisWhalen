Hi! I’m @MattInglisWhalen, a recent PhD graduate from the Univerity of Toronto. For my PhD I worked in theoretical particle physics studying Effective Field Theories for Quantum Chromodynamics.

Nowadays I'm looking to transfer careers to a fun industry where I can use the skills I've gathered over the years. This is my Git repository where I can show off the small projects that interest me.

I’m currently interested in learning about tools for data analysis and/or mathematical finance.

Languages: C++ / Mathematica / Python / SQL 

Tools: Curve-fitting / Mathematical Modelling / Statistics

Still learning: Neural Nets / PDEs
