Hi! Iâ€™m @MattInglisWhalen, a recent PhD graduate from the Univerity of Toronto. For my PhD I worked in 
theoretical particle physics studying Effective Field Theories for Quantum Chromodynamics.

I have recently completed a data science certification at DataCamp in order to translate my skills into 
the day-to-day language and tooling used in the data science industry, and I am eager to begin working 
on interesting problems in the data science industry.

Languages: Python / SQL / C++ / Mathematica / LaTeX

Math Techniques: Multivariable Calculus / Differential Equations / Statistics / Curve-Fitting / Mathematical Modelling

Data Science Tools: scikit-learn / Keras / PyTorch / Pandas / Seaborn / Tableau
